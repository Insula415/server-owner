Firstly, go to https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/ and download selenium 
OR
Type pip3 install selenium in your terminal

Next, install a webdriver, this code is for Chrome. 
You will most likely need to check your Chrome version, you can type "chrome://about"
in your browser and it will tell you the version you're using.

Then go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and install the suitable webdriver.

And that's it! You're good to go.
